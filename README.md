# Explore TDSP
NEBDHub & NSDC Transportation Data Science Project (TDSP)  

This project provided hands-on experience analyzing a dataset of crash incidents from NYC OpenData, covering data from 2012 to 2024, provided by the Police Department (NYPD).

Over the course of the project, I successfully tackled six milestones:  
ðŸ”¹ Data Preparation  
ðŸ”¹ Data Ethics, Pre-Processing, and Exploration  
ðŸ”¹ Time Series Analysis  
ðŸ”¹ Geospatial Analysis  
ðŸ”¹ Self-Guided Research Question  
ðŸ”¹ Virtual Poster Board Creation: Data Storytelling  

My analysis focused on trends in accidents over time and during different times of the day. After analyzing over 2 million rows of data, I found that accident patterns remained consistent, whether COVID-19 happened or not.

Iâ€™d like to extend my gratitude to **Northeast Big Data Innovation Hub (NEBDHub)**, **National Student Data Corps (NSDC)**, and the **U.S. Department of Transportation Federal Highway Administration** for providing this incredible opportunity to learn and grow.
